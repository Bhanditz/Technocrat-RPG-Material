###Stats

You have 9 stats, divided into a three by three grid.

           | Mental       | Social       | Physical  |
-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
Power      | Intelligence | Charisma     | Strength  |
Finesse    | Wits         | Manipulation | Dexterity |
Resistance | Resolve      | Composure    | Stamina   |

The normal human range is from one to five in each of these stats, with two being 'low average' and three being 'high average'.

###Willpower

Willpower is a derived stat. It is your Resolve + Composure. You have both temporary and permanent dots of willpower.

When you have zero temporary willpower, you reach a state called Ego Depletion. While you are afflicted with Ego Depletion, you are easier to hypnotise, brainwash, and flimflam.


###Magical Foci

Foci differ in 'intended scale'. There are six known 'intended scales':

- Personal. Personal scale Foci do not take an action to use. You can not add target or area factors to effects using personal scale Foci.
- Skirmish scale. Skirmish scale Foci take single round actions to use. Targets must be size 10 or smaller. 
- Ship scale. Ship scale Foci take extended actions to use. Targets must be size 100 or smaller. A single platoon can be targetted as a single target.
- Industrial. Industrial scale Foci take weeks to use.
- World spanning. World spanning scale Foci take years to use.
- Cosmic. Cosmic scale Foci take entire Ages to use. No target factors - effects automatically target the Cosmos.

Foci can be used to create effects in other scales, using the target factor, duration, size and action rules for that scale. You take a dice penalty of 8^x, where x is the number of scales you want to move. So, using auto-hypnosis (a Personal Scale Focus) on a Cosmic Scale would levy an 8^5 = 32768 dice penalty to your draw pool.
