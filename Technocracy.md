###Willpower

Willpower is a derived stat. It is your Resolve + Composure. You have both temporary and permanent dots of willpower.
When you have zero temporary willpower, you reach a state called Ego Depletion. While you are afflicted with Ego Deplection, you are easier to hypnotise, brainwash, and flimflam.


###Magical Foci

Foci differ in 'intended scale'. There are six known 'intended scales':

- Personal. Personal scale Foci do not take an action to use. You can not add target or area factors to effects using personal scale Foci.
- Skirmish scale. Skirmish scale Foci take single round actions to use. Targets must be size 10 or smaller. Target factors 
- Ship/Platoon scale
- Industrial
- World spanning
- Cosmic

Foci can be used to create effects in other scales. You take a dice penalty of 8^x, where x is the number of scales you want to move. So, using auto-hypnosis (a Personal Scale Focus) on a Cosmic Scale would levy an 8^5 = 32768 dice penalty to your draw pool.
